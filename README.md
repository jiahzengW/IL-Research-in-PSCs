## Scripts Overview
## Fingerprint framework.py
Constructs dynamic, multifunctional molecular fingerprint framework, Processes the molecular structure data into fingerprints suitable for training and prediction.

## MDN_Construction.py
Constructs a multimodal deep learning network (MDN) model to predict relevant properties for perovskite solar cells.

## MDN_Evaluation.py
Evaluates the MDN model’s performance using test data and calculates error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
